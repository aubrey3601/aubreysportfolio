        <p>My name is Aubrey, and I run customer onboarding for a sofware company that creates apps for Salesforce. I am not from Colorado, but I have been here for about 10 years total. I have two dogs -- Rooney and Zuki (short for Zucchini). I love cheese, NPR, and those darn dogs! I do not like ice in my water.</p>
        <p>I am learning web development because that is what all the cool kids are doing.</p>
